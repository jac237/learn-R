# Smoking Public Data

The public data set is taken from [The National Archives](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100406121330/http://www.stats4schools.gov.uk/large_datasets/smoking/default.asp) (Part 1 CSV):

> Smoking  
> Who is more likely to smoke? What is the most popular type of tobacco?
> 
> This data will allow you to look at the smoking habits of over 1000 participants.

The data was first cleaned using python in the `data-cleaning.ipynb` notebook and then anaylyzed in the `r-analysis.ipynb` notebook.
